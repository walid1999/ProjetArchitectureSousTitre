1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
but I m a man of my word

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,050
first impressions are important

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,750
I need you to know me

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,140
So...

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,900
... back to it.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,050
Noooooooooo 

7
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,900
Buddy, you still there

8
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,950
I just don t know.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,999
It seem like you're trying to speak,

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:01,000
but you just took a hell of a hit.

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
I just popped your skull so hard,

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,200
your eyeball just popped out,

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,765
and it is gross as shit !

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Maggie, I'll find you.

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh.

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh, hell.

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,600
I can see this hard on you guys.

18
00:01:36,015 -->  00:01:38,000
I am sorry.

19
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,375
I truly am.

20
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,850
But I did say it.

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,999
No exceptions !

22
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:16,800
You bunch of pussies.

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,500
I'm just getting started.

24
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,400
Lucille is thirsty.

25
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,800
She is a vampire bat.
